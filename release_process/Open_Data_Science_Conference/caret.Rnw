\frametitle{Model Function Consistency}

Since there are many modeling packages in R written by different people,
there are inconsistencies in how models are specified and
predictions are created.

\vspace{.15in}

For example, many models have only one method of specifying the model
(e.g. formula method only)

\vspace{.1in}

<<form,eval = FALSE>>=
## only one way here:
rpart(y ~ ., data = dat)

## and both ways here:
lda(y ~ ., data = dat)

lda(x = predictors, y = outcome)

\frametitle{The \pkg{caret} Package}

The \href{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/index.html}{\pkg{caret}}  package was developed to:
  \begin{itemize}
\item create a unified interface for modeling and prediction
(interfaces to \Sexpr{length(table(modelLookup()$model))} models)
\item streamline model tuning using resampling
\item provide a variety of ``helper'' functions and classes for day--to--day model building tasks
\item increase computational efficiency using parallel processing
\end{itemize}

One thing that makes \pkg{caret} different from most other packages is that it uses code from an abnormally large number ($> 80$) of other packages.

\vspace{.1in}

A refresher:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Depends}: required for package to function; loaded when \pkg{caret} is loaded
\item \texttt{Imports}: required for package to function; not loaded
\item \texttt{Suggests}: the package uses it sometimes; not loaded
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Package Dependencies}


Originally, these were in the \texttt{Depends} field of the \textt{DESCRIPTION} file which caused all of them to be loaded with \pkg{caret}.

\vspace{.15in}

For many years, they were moved to \texttt{Suggests}, which solved that issue.


\vspace{.15in}

However, their formal dependency in the \textt{DESCRIPTION} file required CRAN  to install hundreds of other packages to check  \pkg{caret}. The maintainers were not pleased.

\frametitle{Package Dependencies}

This problem was somewhat alleviated at the end of 2013 when {\em custom methods} were expanded.

\vspace{.1in}

Although this functionality had already existed in the package for some time, it was refactored to be more user friendly.

\vspace{.1in}

In the process, much of the modeling code was moved out of \pkg{caret}'s R files and into R objects, eliminating the formal dependencies.

\vspace{.1in}

Right now, the {\em total} number of dependencies is much smaller (2 \texttt{Depends}, 7 \texttt{Imports}, and 25 \texttt{Suggests}).

\vspace{.1in}

This still affects testing though (described later). Also:

\item regression tests for consistency
\end{itemize}

\vspace{.2in}

Automated unit testing via \href{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/index.html}{\pkg{testthat}}

\begin{itemize}
\item \href{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/index.html}{\pkg{devtools}}{\tt ::\mxkwd{use\_testhat}}
\item Unit tests prevent new features from breaking old code
\item All functions should have associated tests
\item Run during {\tt R CMD check --as-cran}
\item Can specify that certain tests be skipped on CRAN
\end{itemize}

\href{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/index.html}{\pkg{caret}} is slowly adding more \href{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/index.html}{\pkg{testthat}} tests

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{github + travis + coveralls}

Travis and coveralls are tools for automated unit testing
\begin{itemize}
\item Travis reports test failures and CRAN errors/warnings
\item Coveralls reports \% of code covered by unit tests
\item Both automatically comment on the PR itself
\end{itemize}

\vspace{.1in}

Contributor submits code via a pull request

\begin{itemize}
\item Travis notifies them of test failures
\item Coveralls notifies them to write tests for new functions
\item Automated feedback on code quality allows rapid iteration

  \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Regression Testing}

Prior to CRAN release (or whenever required), a comprehensive set of regression tests can be  conducted.

\vspace{.1in}

All modeling packages are updated to their current CRAN versions.

\vspace{.1in}

For each model accessed by \mxkwd{train}, \mxkwd{rfe}, and/or \mxkwd{sbf}, a set of test cases are computed with the production version of \pkg{caret} and the devel version.

\vspace{.1in}

First, test cases are evaluated to make sure that nothing has been broken by updated versions of the consistuent packages.

\vspace{.1in}

Diffs of the model results are computed to assess any differences in \pkg{caret} versions.

\vspace{.1in}

This process takes approximately 3hrs to complete using \texttt{make -j 12} on a Mac Pro.

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Regression Testing}

Typical tests include:
\begin{itemize}
\item tests for different resampling methods ({\bf LOOCV}!)
\item formula vs. non-formula interface
\item predictions
\item variable importance
\item ancillary classes/functions (e.g. \mxkwd{predictors})
\end{itemize}

\vspace{.1in}

In some cases, we need to correlate results between versions due to random numbers without seed control.

\vspace{.1in}

I send a lot of emails/pull requests to package maintainers (e.g. class probabilities don't sum to 1, predictions fail with $n=1$, etc. )

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Documentation}

\pkg{caret} originally contained four package vignettes with in--depth descriptions of functionality with examples.

\vspace{.15in}

However, this added time to \texttt{R CMD check} and was a general pain for CRAN.

\vspace{.15in}

Efforts to make the vignettes more computationally efficient (e.g. reducing the number of examples, resamples, etc.) diminished the effectiveness of the documentation.


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Documentation}

The documentation was moved out of the package and to the github IO page.

\vspace{.15in}


These pages are built using \pkg{knitr} whenever a new version is sent to CRAN. Some advantages are:

\begin{itemize}
\item longer and more relevant examples are available
\item update schedule is under my control
\item dynamic documentation (e.g. D3 network graphs, JS tables)
\item better formatting
\end{itemize}

\vspace{.1in}

It currently takes about 4hr to create these (using parallel processing when possible).

\end{frame}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Required ``Optimizations'' for CRAN}


For example, there is one check that produces a large number of false positive warnings. For example:

<<subset, eval = FALSE>>=
bwplot.diff.resamples <- function (x, data, metric = x$metric, ...)  {
    ## some code
    plotData <- subset(plotData, Metric %in% metric)
    ## more code
}
@

will trigger a warning that ``{\tt \small bwplot.diff.resamples: no visible binding for global variable 'Metric'}''.

\vspace{.15in}

The ``solution'' is to have a file that is sourced first in the package (e.g. \texttt{aaa.R}) with the line

<<subset_fix, eval = FALSE>>=
Metric <- NULL
@

\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Judging the Severity of Problems}

It's hard to tell which warnings should be ignored and which should not. There is also the issue of inconsistencies related to who is ``on duty'' when you submit your package.

\vspace{.1in}

It is hard to believe that someone took the time for this:

\vspace{.15in}
\begin{footnotesize}

{\tt R CMD check: "{\color{red}Malformed Description field: should contain one or more complete sentences.}"}

\vspace{.15in}
