## Install the current release from CRAN:

```r
install.packages('caret')
```

## Install the development version from GitHub:
```r
pak::pak('topepo/caret/pkg/caret')
```

## Status

caret will be 20 years old in March of 2026. The package is currently in *maintenance mode*; the author will fix bugs and make CRAN releases as needed, but there will not be any major features in the package. **It will stay on CRAN long-term**; it's not going away.
