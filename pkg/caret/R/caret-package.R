#' Blood Brain Barrier Data
#'
#' Mente and Lombardo (2005) develop models to predict the log
#' of the ratio of the concentration of a compound in the brain
#' and the concentration in blood. For each compound, they computed
#' three sets of molecular descriptors: MOE 2D, rule-of-five and
#' Charge Polar Surface Area (CPSA). In all, 134 descriptors were
#' calculated. Included in this package are 208 non-proprietary
#' literature compounds. The vector \code{logBBB} contains the concentration
#' ratio and the data fame \code{bbbDescr} contains the descriptor values.

#' COX-2 Activity Data
#'
#' From Sutherland, O'Brien, and Weaver (2003): "A set of 467 cyclooxygenase-2
#' (COX-2) inhibitors has been assembled from the published work of a single
#' research group, with in vitro activities against human recombinant enzyme
#' expressed as IC50 values ranging from 1 nM to >100 uM (53 compounds have
#' indeterminate IC50 values)."
#'
#' The data are in the Supplemental Data file for the article.
#'
#' A set of 255 descriptors (MOE2D and QikProp) were generated. To classify the
#' data, we used a cutoff of $2^2.5$ to determine activity

#' German Credit Data
#'
#' Data from Dr. Hans Hofmann of the University of Hamburg.
#'
#' These data have two classes for the credit worthiness: good or bad. There
#' are predictors related to attributes, such as: checking account status,
#' duration, credit history, purpose of the loan, amount of the loan, savings
#' accounts or bonds, employment duration, Installment rate in percentage of
#' disposable income, personal information, other debtors/guarantors, residence
#' duration, property, age, other installment plans, housing, number of
#' existing credits, job information, Number of people being liable to provide
#' maintenance for, telephone, and foreign worker status.
#'
#' Many of these predictors are discrete and have been expanded into several
#' 0/1 indicator variables

#' Multidrug Resistance Reversal (MDRR) Agent Data
#'
#' Svetnik et al. (2003) describe these data: "Bakken and Jurs studied a set of
#' compounds originally discussed by Klopman et al., who were interested in
#' multidrug resistance reversal (MDRR) agents. The original response variable
#' is a ratio measuring the ability of a compound to reverse a leukemia cell's
#' resistance to adriamycin. However, the problem was treated as a
#' classification problem, and compounds with the ratio >4.2 were considered
#' active, and those with the ratio <= 2.0 were considered inactive. Compounds
#' with the ratio between these two cutoffs were called moderate and removed
#' from the data for twoclass classification, leaving a set of 528 compounds
#' (298 actives and 230 inactives). (Various other arrangements of these data
#' were examined by Bakken and Jurs, but we will focus on this particular one.)
#' We did not have access to the original descriptors, but we generated a set
#' of 342 descriptors of three different types that should be similar to the
#' original descriptors, using the DRAGON software."

#' Cell Body Segmentation
#'
#' Hill, LaPan, Li and Haney (2007) develop models to predict which cells in a

#' measurements on 2019. The original analysis used 1009 for training and 1010
#' as a test set (see the column called \code{Case}).
#'
#' The outcome class is contained in a factor variable called \code{Class} with
#' levels "PS" for poorly segmented and "WS" for well segmented.
#'
#' The raw data used in the paper can be found at the Biomedcentral website.
#' Versions of caret < 4.98 contained the original data. The version now
#' contained in \code{segmentationData} is modified. First, several discrete
#' versions of some of the predictors (with the suffix "Status") were removed.
#' Second, there are several skewed predictors with minimum values of zero
#' (that would benefit from some transformation, such as the log). A constant
#' value of 1 was added to these fields: \code{AvgIntenCh2},
