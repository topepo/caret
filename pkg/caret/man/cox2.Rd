\description{
From Sutherland, O'Brien, and Weaver (2003): "A set of 467 cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2) inhibitors has been assembled from the published work of a single
research group, with in vitro activities against human recombinant enzyme
expressed as IC50 values ranging from 1 nM to >100 uM (53 compounds have
indeterminate IC50 values)."
}
\details{
The data are in the Supplemental Data file for the article.

A set of 255 descriptors (MOE2D and QikProp) were generated. To classify the
data, we used a cutoff of $2^2.5$ to determine activity
